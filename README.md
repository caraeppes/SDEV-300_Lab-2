Week 2 Deliverables

Overview: This week, you have studied additional Python language syntax including functions The Lab
for this week demonstrates your knowledge of this additional Python functionality.
Submission requirements for this project include 2 files. (Zipping them into one file is acceptable and
encouraged):
 Python Command Line Math and Security Related Application Code
 Word or PDF file containing your test and pylint results

Python Applications for this Lab: (total 100 points):
The first exercise produces a command line menu-driven python application providing users with the
ability to perform several math and security related functions. The second part documents your testing
and pylint analysis results.
1. (80 points) Create a menu-driven python application with following menu options for users to
run at the command line:
a. Generate Secure Password
b. Calculate and Format a Percentage
c. How many days from today until July 4, 2025?
d. Use the Law of Cosines to calculate the leg of a triangle.
e. Calculate the volume of a Right Circular Cylinder
f. Exit program

As you put this menu together be sure to adhere to the following guidance and hints:
1. Create functions to be called sending in the parameters the user enters.
2. Validate input data to ensure each entry from the user is correct before proceeding.
3. Prompt the user to reenter information as needed.
4. The following Python sites are excellent resources for learning more about the string,
datetime, secrets, math, and random number libraries mentioned in the readings that
you should use as part of this exercise.
  i. https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html
  ii. https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html
  iii. https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html
  iv. https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html
  v. https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html
5. Use comments to document your code
6. Test with many combinations.
7. Use pylint to verify the code style – the goal is a 10!
